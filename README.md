## Installation

**Note:** Before installing Ledermann Rails Settings Update make sure to setup the original [Ledermann Rails Settings](https://github.com/ledermann/rails-settings) gem.

Ledermann Rails Settings Update works with Rails 5 onwards. You can add it to your `Gemfile` with:

```ruby
gem 'ledermann-rails-settings-update'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install ledermann-rails-settings-update

If you always want to be up to date fetch the latest from GitHub in your `Gemfile`:

## Usage

### Forms

Let's say we have this `Post` model:

```ruby
class Post < ApplicationRecord
    has_settings do |s|
        s.key :preferences, defaults: { language: 'en' }
    end
end
```

To update this `preferences/language` setting, a form could look like this:

```haml
= simple_form_for @post, url: @post, html: { method: :put } do |f|
    = f.input :title
    = text_field_tag 'post[settings][preferences][language]'
    = f.input :submit
```

### Controllers

Here is a corresponding controller:

```ruby
class PostsController < ApplicationController

    def update
        @post = Post.find params[:id]
        update_settings @post
        @post.update! post_params
        redirect_back fallback_location: root_path, notice: 'Post updated'
    end

    private

    def post_params
        params.require(:post).permit(:title)
    end

    def settings_params
        params.require(:post).permit(
            settings: [
                preferences: [:language]
            ]
        )
    end

end
```

**Note:** The `private` `settings_params` method is required.
